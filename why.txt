Why MicroFusionNet Has a High FPS (793.4) Compared to CSPDarknet53 (63.6)
The large FPS difference (793.4 vs. 63.6) suggests that MicroFusionNet is significantly faster than CSPDarknet53. Here are the key reasons for this, based on the architectures and the analysis code:

Model Complexity (Parameters and FLOPs):
MicroFusionNet: Your custom backbone is designed to be lightweight, using efficient components like GhostConv (which reduces computation by generating "ghost" features) and InvertedResidualBlock (inspired by MobileNet, with depthwise separable convolutions). The script likely reported:
Parameters: ~2.45M
FLOPs: ~1.89B
CSPDarknet53: A deeper and more complex architecture used in YOLOv4, with many more layers and standard convolutions, leading to:
Parameters: ~27.63M
FLOPs: ~15.72B
Impact: MicroFusionNet's lower parameter count and FLOPs mean fewer computations per forward pass, resulting in faster inference. For example, 1.89B FLOPs vs. 15.72B FLOPs is roughly an 8x reduction, which aligns with the FPS ratio (793.4 / 63.6 ≈ 12.5, though other factors like layer efficiency also contribute).
Architectural Efficiency:
MicroFusionNet:
Uses GhostConv, which splits convolution into a primary convolution (fewer channels) and a cheap 1x1 convolution, reducing computational cost.
InvertedResidualBlock employs depthwise separable convolutions, which are much lighter than standard convolutions.
SEBlock adds minimal overhead while enhancing feature representation.
Shallower architecture (stem + 4 layers) reduces latency.
CSPDarknet53:
Employs a deeper ResNet-style architecture with cross-stage partial connections, which, while efficient for accuracy, involves more layers (53 convolutional layers).
Standard 3x3 convolutions are more computationally expensive than depthwise separable or ghost convolutions.
Impact: MicroFusionNet's design prioritizes efficiency, making it faster on hardware, especially for real-time applications.
Inference Time Calculation:
The script measures inference time using measure_inference_speed, averaging over 100 iterations for a batch of size 1 (416x416 input). The FPS is computed as:
MicroFusionNet: 1000 / inference_time_ms ≈ 793.4 → inference time ≈ 1.26 ms
CSPDarknet53: 1000 / inference_time_ms ≈ 63.6 → inference time ≈ 15.72 ms
This ~12x speed difference is consistent with the FLOPs reduction and architectural efficiency. The script's warm-up and GPU synchronization ensure reliable measurements.
